		<h2>What is Errai?</h2>

		<p>Errai is a framework which combines a constellation of web and server-side technologies to assist you in
		   developing
		   large, scalable rich web applications using a consistent, standardized programming model for client and server
		   development.
		</p>

		<h2>Core Technologies</h2>

		<p>Errai is an end-to-end framework, in that, parts of the framework run and operate within the client and parts
		   run and operate within the server. To accomplish this, Errai relies on a set of various technologies as
		   explained below. If you are not already familiar with these technologies, it is advisable to read up on them
		   before you start using Errai.

		<h2>What's in this guide?</h2>
		<p>This tutorial will walk you through using Errai to build a web application. We'll start with a barebones Errai app,
			 and explore Errai's various features by adding functionality to the app. Once you complete all the steps in this
			 guide, you should end up with something like <a href="http://javaone2013-csadilek.rhcloud.com">this</a>.

		<h2>Required Software</h2>
		<p>This is a list of the software you will need to start developing with Errai.</p>

		<h3>Java Development Kit</h3>

    <p>We recommend using version 7 of the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">Oracle JDK.</a></p>

    <h3>Maven</h3>

    <p>Maven is a dependency management tool that we will use to build our Errai Application.
      <b>In order to install and use Maven, you will need to have the JDK installed.</b>
       Errai requires Maven version 3+. Instructions for downloading and installing Maven are on <a
      href="http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi">this page</a>.
      <br/>
       Run <code>mvn --version</code> on the command line to ensure that you have the correct version installed.
    </p>

    <h3>WildFly Application Server</h3>

    <p>WildFly is an Application Server which we will use to host our Errai Application locally. In the tutorial we will be using WildFly 8.1.0.Final.
       You can download a zipped copy of WildFly 8 from <a href="wildfly.org/downloads">this link</a>. No installation is necessary. Simply unzip it
       into the target/ directory of your Errai project. <!--TODO: rephrase last sentence-->
