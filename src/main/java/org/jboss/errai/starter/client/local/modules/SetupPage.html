		<h2>Create your first app</h2>

		<p>There are two ways for you to create your first Errai application. You can use our sample app, Errai Tutorial,
			as a starting point, or you can create a barebones Errai app using JBoss Forge, that will have all the basic
			dependencies in place for you. To get familiar with Errai, we recommend creating a new app and developing it using
			the steps in this guide. If you prefer to learn by example, the Errai Tutorial is a better option for you. Both
			options are explained in detail below:</p>

		<h3>Option 1: Errai Tutorial</h3>

		<p>
			The Errai Tutorial is a basic sample application that showcases all the major features of Errai. You can use it both
			as an example to explore Errai's functionality and as a base upon which to build your own more complex web app. The
			Errai Tutorial can be downloaded from the GitHub repository <a href="https://github.com/errai/errai-tutorial">here</a>.
		</p>

		<h3>Option 2: Create a new app with JBoss Forge</h3>

		<p>
			To get you started with your first Errai app, we will use JBoss Forge and the Errai Forge Addon to create a new app
			with the basic dependencies already in place. Instructions for downloading and using the Forge addon are on the <a
				href="#ForgeAddonPage"> Errai Forge Addon Page</a>.
		</p>
		<h4>Hello World!</h4>

		<p>
			Now that you have an empty Errai app set up with the Forge addon, you need to be able to run it. We'll first add some
			simple code so you can see something when you run the app. <strong>Make sure you have a copy of Wildfly 8 in
				the target/ directory of your new app for debugging purposes.</strong>
		</p>

		<span class="tip textblock">TIP: Before you add the code snippet below, use the Errai Forge Addon to add <code>errai-cdi-integration</code>
			to your project for it to run properly.
		</span>

		<p>
			Create a new subfolder <code>client/local/</code> under the folder which contains your GWT module file (with the
			extension .gwt.xml). In our example, the GWT module file <code>ErraiDemo.gwt.xml</code> is located in the directory <code>errai-forge-demo/src/main/java/org/jboss/errai/demo/</code>.
		</p>

		<p>
			In the new <code>client/local/</code> subfolder, create a file called App.java with the following contents:
		</p>

		<h5>App.java</h5>
		<pre class="code-snippet" data-language="java">
	  package org.jboss.errai.demo.client.local;

	  import javax.annotation.PostConstruct;
	  import org.jboss.errai.ioc.client.api.EntryPoint;
	  import com.google.gwt.user.client.Window;

	  @EntryPoint
	  public class App {
		  @PostConstruct
		  public void onLoad() {
			  Window.alert("Hello World!");
		  }
	  }
        </pre>

		<h4>Running your app</h4>

		<p>
			Errai apps run exactly like any other GWT apps. Since Errai 3.1.0.Final, <a
				href="http://www.gwtproject.org/articles/superdevmode.html">GWT's Super Dev Mode</a> is available to run and debug
			Errai apps. To run your app, type the following in terminal in your app's main directory:
		</p>

		<code class="textblock">mvn clean gwt:run</code>

		<p>You should see your page load with a "Hello World!" popup alert. Congratulations! You just successfully ran
			your first Errai app!</p>

		<br />
		<h4>Debugging your app</h4>

		<p>GWT's Super Dev Mode also supports debugging via source maps. Super Dev Mode compiles Java code into JavaScript
			to run natively in the browser. With browsers that support source maps, it is possible to debug your code directly in
			the browser.</p>

		<p>Now that you know how to run your Errai app, it's time to make it even more awesome by adding some more Errai
			features! You can learn about them by navigating the links on the left side, or by clicking Next below.</p>
