    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>The Errai UI module uses a combination of GWT Widgets and HTML5 templating to create UI components. Errai UI's Widgets are
    functionally the same as GWT Composite Widgets, except that they derive their styling from HTML templates. This separates the UI's
    aesthetics from the widget's software functionality, allowing you to use HTML5 and CSS to style your web pages and eliminating the need
    for painstaking Java styling.
