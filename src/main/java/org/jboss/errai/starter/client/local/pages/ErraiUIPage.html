		<h2>Introduction</h2>

		<p>With Errai UI, you can use HTML5 templating for your GWT
			Widgets. Errai UI's Widgets arefunctionally the same as GWT Composite
			Widgets, except that they derive their styling from HTML templates.
			This separates the UI'slayout design from the widget's software
			functionality, allowing you to use HTML5 and CSS to style your web
			pages and eliminating the need for painstaking Java styling.</p>

		<h2>Installation Instructions</h2>

		<h3>Errai Forge Addon</h3>

		<p>
			To run the code in this section in your own app, use the Errai Forge
			Addon <i>Add Errai Features</i> command to add
			<code>errai-ui</code>
			to your project.
		</p>

		<h3>Manual Installation</h3>

		<p>To manually add Errai UI to your classpath, follow these steps:</p>

		<h4>Maven Dependencies</h4>

		<p>Add the following dependency to your classpath:</p>
		<pre data-language=html class="code-snippet">
     <dependency>
       <groupId>org.jboss.errai</groupId>
       <artifactId>errai-ui</artifactId>
       <version>${errai.version}</version>
       <scope>provided</scope>
     </dependency>
		</pre>

		<h4>GWT Module Descriptor</h4>

		<p>Once you have added the dependency, your application must
			inherit the GWT module as well. Add the following line to your
			.gwt.xml file:</p>
		<pre data-language="html" class="code-snippet">
	  <inherits name="org.jboss.errai.ui.UI" >
	</pre>

		<h2>Using Errai UI</h2>

		<p>
			Once built, Errai UI components are essentially the same as other GWT
			Widgets. The only difference is in their construction and
			instantiation. As with most other features in Errai, dependency
			injection using CDI is the programming model of choice, so you should
			always
			<code>@Inject</code>
			all references to your Composite components.
		</p>
