    <h2>Create your first app</h2>

    <p>There are two ways for you to create your first Errai application. You can use our sample app, Errai Tutorial, as a
    starting point, or you can create a barebones Errai app using JBoss Forge, that will have all the basic dependencies in place for
    you. Both options are explained in detail below. To get familiar with Errai, we recommend creating a new app and developing it
    using the steps in this guide. If you prefer to learn by example, the Errai Tutorial is a better option for you.
    </p>

    <h3>Errai Tutorial</h3>

    <p>The Errai Tutorial is a basic sample application that showcases all the major features of Errai. You can use it both as an example to
       explore
       Errai's functionality and as a base upon which to build your own more complex web app. The Errai Tutorial can be downloaded from the
       GitHub repository <a href="https://github.com/errai/errai-tutorial">here</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>JBoss Forge</h3>

    <p>To get you started with your first Errai app, we will use JBoss Forge and the Errai Forge Addon to create a new app with the basic
       dependencies already in place. Instructions for downloading and using the Forge addon are on the <a href="#ForgeAddonPage">
        Errai Forge Addon Page</a>.

    <h4>Hello World!</h4>

    <p>Now that you have an empty Errai app set up with the Forge addon, you need to be able to run it. We'll first add some simple code
       so you can see something when you run the app. <strong>Make sure you have a copy of Wildfly 8 in the target/ directory of
                                                              your new app for debugging purposes.</strong></p>

       <span class="tip textblock">TIP: Before you add the code snippet below, use the Errai Forge Addon to add Errai IOC to your
                                   project so that your app runs properly.</span>

    <p>Create a new subfolder <code>client/local/</code> under the folder which contains your GWT module file (with the extension
       .gwt.xml). In our example, the GWT module file <code>ErraiDemo.gwt.xml</code> is located in the directory
       <code>errai-forge-demo/src/main/java/org/jboss/errai/demo/</code>.</p>

    <p>In the new <code>client/local/</code> subfolder, create a file called App.java with the following contents:</p>

    <h5>App.java</h5>
    <pre class="code-snippet col-lg-6" data-language="java">
    package org.jboss.errai.demo.client.local;

    import javax.annotation.PostConstruct;
    import org.jboss.errai.ioc.client.api.EntryPoint;
    import com.google.gwt.user.client.Window;

    @EntryPoint
    public class App {
      @PostConstruct
      public void onLoad() {
        Window.alert("Hello World!");
      }
    }
    </pre>
