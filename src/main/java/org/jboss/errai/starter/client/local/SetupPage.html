    <h2>Java Development Kit</h2>

    <p>We recommend using version 7 of the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">Oracle JDK.</a></p>

    <h2>Maven</h2>

    <p>Maven is a dependency management tool that we will use to build our Errai Application.
      <b>In order to install and use Maven, you will need to have the JDK installed.</b>
       Errai requires Maven version 3+. Instructions for downloading and installing Maven are on <a
      href="http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi">this page</a>.
      <br/>
       Run <code>mvn --version</code> on the command line to ensure that you have the correct version installed.
    </p>

    <h2>WildFly Application Server</h2>

    <p>WildFly is an Application Server which we will use to host our Errai Application locally. In the tutorial we will be using WildFly 8.1.0.Final.
       You can download a zipped copy of WildFly 8 from <a href="wildfly.org/downloads">this link</a>. No installation is necessary. Simply unzip it
       to wherever you would like the applicationâ€™s directory to be located. <!--TODO: rephrase last sentence-->
    </p>

    <h2>JBoss Forge</h2>

    <p>To get you started with your first Errai app, we will use JBoss Forge and the Errai Forge Addon to create a new app with the basic
       dependencies already in place. Download the latest version of JBoss Forge <a href="http://forge.jboss.org/download">here</a>.
      <br/>
      </p>
    <p>
       Add Forge to your PATH environment variable. In Linux, you can add the following line to your $HOME/.bashrc file:

    </p>

    <p>
      Once installed, you need to add the Errai Forge Addon to your installation to create a new Errai app.
