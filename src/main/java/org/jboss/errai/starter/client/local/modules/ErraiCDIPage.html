    <div class="page">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>
            All of Errai's features are built around Errai's core modules, Errai CDI and Errai IOC. The Errai IOC module
            implements the <i>JSR-330 Dependency Injection</i> specification, whereas the Errai CDI module implements
            <i>JSR-299 Contexts and Dependency Injection</i>. This section will provide some basic information on how to
            use these modules, as they are used by all of Errai's features.
        </p>

        <h2>Installation Instructions</h2>

        <p>
            Note that if you are using Errai Tutorial to follow along, you can skip these installation steps as all of
            Errai's modules are already installed for you.
        </p>

        <h3>Errai Forge Addon</h3>

        <p>
            To use Errai CDI and IOC, use the Errai Forge Addon to add the <i>Errai CDI</i> feature to your project.
        </p>

        <h3>Manual Installation</h3>

        <p>
            If you are not using the Errai Forge Addon, add the following dependencies to your project.
        </p>

        <h4>Maven Dependencies</h4>

        <p>Add the following dependencies to your pom.xml</p>
      <pre class="code-snippet" data-language="html">
    &lt;dependency&gt;
      &lt;groupId&gt;org.jboss.errai&lt;/groupId&gt;
      &lt;artifactId&gt;errai-javaee-all&lt;/artifactId&gt;
      &lt;version&gt;${errai.version}&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;/dependency&gt;
      </pre>

        <h4>GWT Module Descriptor</h4>
        <p>Once you have Errai CDI and IOC on your classpath, ensure your application inherits the GWT modules as well. Add
        these lines to your applicationâ€™s *.gwt.xml file:
        </p>
		<pre data-language=html class="code-snippet">
    &lt;inherits name="org.jboss.errai.ioc.Container"/&gt;
    &lt;inherits name="org.jboss.errai.enterprise.CDI"/&gt;
		</pre>

        <p class="tip textblock">TIP: In our example, the GWT module file is located at <code>src/main/java/org/jboss/errai/demo/ErraiDemo.gwt.xml</code>
        </p>

        <p class="tip textblock">NOTE: Any classpath locations that are to be scanned by Errai CDI must have a file
            called <code>ErraiApp.properties</code> at their root. Without this file, none of Errai CDI's features will
            work.
        </p>

        <h2>Using Errai CDI and IOC</h2>
        <p>
            Errai CDI and IOC use various annotations within your code to provide functionality and eliminate
            unnecessary code. This section will highlight and explain the most common ones. For detailed
            information regarding the supported annotations, please refer to the documentation of <a
        href="http://docs.jboss.org/errai/3.1.2.Final/errai/reference/html_single/#sid-5931402">Errai IOC</a> and <a
        href="http://docs.jboss.org/errai/3.1.2.Final/errai/reference/html_single/#sid-19398999">Errai CDI</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>Scopes</h3>

        <p>
            The Errai IOC container supports three major scopes: <code><b>@Dependent, @Singleton</b></code> and
            <code><b> @EntryPoint</b></code>. The <code><b>@Singleton</b></code> and <code><b>@EntryPoint</b></code>
            scopes are semantically the same. They are used to indicate that only one instance of this bean is used
            throughout the app. You can also use the <code> <b>@ApplicationScoped</b></code> annotation on your bean
            to achieve the same effect.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Dependent scope is the default scope assigned to all unqualified client types. This means that a new
            bean of this type is created for every different instantiation within the code, and is not shared across
            objects.
        </p>
        <h3>Other important annotations</h3>

        <h4>Inject</h4>
        <p>
            <code><b>@Inject</b></code> is the most commonly used annotation in Errai IOC. It can be used to annotate
            fields in a Java class, which will then automatically be "injected" into the class without the need for
            manual instantation. The example below describes how to use this annotation:
        </p>

        <h5>LoginForm.java</h5>
        <pre class="code-snippet" data-language="java">
    public class LoginForm extends Composite{

      // A username textbox is now available for use without any further setup
      @Inject
      public TextBox username;

    }
        </pre>

        <h4>PostConstruct</h4>
        <p>
            Often you may need to complete some initialization steps on a widget before it is displayed. In this case,
            you can make use of the <code><b>@PostConstruct</b></code> annotation on your setup method. The method will
            then be invoked immediately after dependency injection and before the bean is put into service.
        </p>
        <h5>LoginForm.java</h5>
        <pre class="code-snippet" data-language="java">
    public class LoginForm extends Composite {

      @Inject
      public TextBox username;

      // Some code

      // Invoked just after injection for setup purposes
      @PostConstruct
      public void onLoad() {
        username.setMaxLength(length);
      }
    }
        </pre>
